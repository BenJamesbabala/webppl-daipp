\section{Specifying Guides}
\label{sec:guideSpec}

Specifying guide families -- shared control flow, different data flow.

Sample and its guide option

Parameters: creating and referencing, re-use? For now, assume all params are explicitly named.

The MapData pattern: global vs local, learning vs recognition

Model learning as variational inference. Model uncertainty. How easy it is to switch from maximum likelihood (+ regularization) to full Bayes.

Running examples: Simple Bayes nets. Go from one continuous latent to two continuous latents to one continuous and one discrete latent.
