Conclude, restate contributions. Discuss what we learned, etc.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion_futureWork}

Yield-so-far, accumulative models (cite NGPM).

More possibilities for auto-guide architectures: neural Turing machines (external memory might be better for capturing certain long-range dependencies), neural programmer-interpreter (the `stack' of recurrent networks, which communicate via arguments, might be a better representation for soe programs).

Tutorial training and combinations with SMC (also from NGPM), wakey-sleepy(?)

Variable re-ordering (i.e. the truly `backwards' model, cite stochastic inverse paper + Brooks's neural net version of stochastic inverses). More general control flow changes?
