Conclude, restate contributions. Discuss what we learned, etc.

\subsection{Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion_futureWork}

Yield-so-far, accumulative models (cite NGPM).

Tutorial training and combinations with SMC (also from NGPM), wakey-sleepy(?)

Variable re-ordering (i.e. the truly `backwards' model, cite stochastic inverse paper + Brooks's neural net version of stochastic inverses).
