Using forward sampling or SMC with params.
Using globalStore.data to switch between train/test datasets.

Can run more optimization, passing params back in (e.g. for fine-tuning to a different dataset).

Can also re-use params for a different model (e.g. calling Optimize on a different model that has some of the same named parameters).
